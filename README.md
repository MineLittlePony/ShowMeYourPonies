Show Me Your Pony! (the exclamation mark is unimportant) is a client-side mod and addon for [Mine Little Pony](https://modrinth.com/mod/mine-little-pony) that allows the [Show Me Your Skin!](https://modrinth.com/mod/show-me-your-skin) mod to work with the pony models. Amazing!

It uses the integrated armour apis provided by Mine Little Pony to achieve this.

## Ponies Galore!

All the armour hiding options you could ever need, now working with your pony, including:

 - Individual configuration of each armor piece and elytra/shield:
   - Arbitrary transparency
   - Invisibility
   - Enchant glint hiding
 - The other stuff

You wouldn't believe how hard that is to do in markdown. (Hint: Very)


## Context-sensitive ponies

Are you a plebian who doesn't play as a pony? Or do you have friends, or vaguely-familiar strangers you occassionally see on public servers who are not ponies themselves?

Never fear!

Well, fear a little, but not to an unneccessary degree, because this mod does not interfere with the regular [Show Me Your Skin!](https://modrinth.com/mod/show-me-your-skin) mod! Nope! We only affect ponies, so your fellow plebian non-friends need not worry about their armour appearing to be _unsatisfactory_.

## Multiplayer support

... is not neccessary! I mean, you can put it in if you want to, but it won't really do anything. The [Show Me Your Skin!](https://modrinth.com/mod/show-me-your-skin) mod handles all of the complex work, we only make sure they apply to ponies too!
